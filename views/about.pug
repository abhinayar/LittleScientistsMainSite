                  br
                  span.answer I fell in love  with science growing up and attending public school in New Haven , Connecticut. A hands-on science teacher helped light the bulb of innovation and creativity in me and I hope to pass the torch forward by igniting curiosity in all young children.

                  br
                  span.answer I  was very blessed to have a world class education that culminated in several advanced degrees and opportunities to experience science research on a level that would result in a Nobel Prize  for a team that I was privileged to be  a part of.

                  br
                  span.answer I saw what it was like if you don’t always get that helping hand, that special someone who says you can do it. So many people have played that role in my life.  Long ago, I knew having been blessed to raise three children and rediscovering their sense of wonder and natural curiosity, that a focus on children and science would be my life’s professional journey.

                  br
                  span.answer I want all students who participate in hands on science learning to strengthen their inner scientist and their power to achieve.   Children have that curiosity and we as adults and educators must nurture it carefully and with a joyous celebration of that potential.
